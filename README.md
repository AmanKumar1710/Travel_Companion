# Travel_Companion
The Travel Companion project is an innovative web-based platform designed to simplify and 
enhance the travel experience by integrating a range of essential tools into a single, cohesive 
system. This mini-project includes key components such as a booking section, weather 
forecasting system, language translator, expense tracker, and a to-do list planner. Each 
component has been meticulously developed using modern web technologies to ensure an 
intuitive, user-friendly interface and seamless functionality.
